split hingeOne to allow for better printing and screw in with screws


### notes
For connecting different parts, what should be done is a pin and hinge. The pin is going to be half smooth and half threaded. One part is glued into the one part, and the other screwed into the other part. Each half of the screwed part is going to be in different handed-ness (right hand and left hand) so the parts can articulate.

Issues with this - high part count, and screwing and unscrewing relies on tension from the parts. Printing in PLA makes this warp, and to fix it the only solution is to reprint everything. Try to find something that reduces part count and is repairable.

For splitting hingeOne for better printability, thinking of doing stairway cut halfway horizontal, stairway cut vertical from bottom up to that horizontal halfway and screwholes into each so they can be screwed together. I don't _think_ this is an issue with part count since the only reason I'm parting it out is so I can get better print quality, the design is still legit and I can't think of a better way of desigining hingeOne.
